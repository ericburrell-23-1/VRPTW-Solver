# VRPTW Solver Using LA-Discretization

This project is an implmentation of the VRPTW Solving Algorithm using the LA-Discretization method developed by Mandal et al. 2024 and described in their paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00262). It was used on the Solomon Benchmark data sets, included in this repository (formatted as .csv files in the `data_sets` directory).

More info on this project will follow in later commits.
